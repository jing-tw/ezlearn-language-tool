In a foreign country, I don’t wanna speak “word by word” to communication with people. I wanna speak as like as a native speaker. EZLearn is a tool that is designed for me to achieve this topic. Not only for English but also on song and translation. For example, you can use this tool to learn Chinese language.

"If you can speak, then you can listen". Based on this concept, EZLearn is designed as a repeater for giving any audio section. We can focus on any section that we want to clarify or want to training our brain , speak.

Thanks for .Net framework, EZLearn supports almost audio format such as wav, mp3, wma ... etc.

Enjoy.
